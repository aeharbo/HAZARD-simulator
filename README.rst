GCR Simulation Framework — Main Scripts Overview (WORK IN PROGRESS)
###################################################################

This repository implements a modular simulation pipeline for studying galactic cosmic ray (GCR) interactions with space-based detectors, specifically tailored for HgCdTe infrared arrays (e.g., as used in the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope). The framework enables detailed Monte Carlo simulations of particle events and advanced visualization of charge diffusion and detector response.

Three primary scripts form the backbone of the simulation and analysis workflow:

NEW WORKFLOW STEPS

.. code-block:: python
    
    import hazard_simulator.gcrsim as sim
    import hazard_simulator.electronspread2 as es
    import hazard_simulator.ffrng as ffrng

    simulator = sim.CosmicRaySimulation # set up simulator object
    data = simulator.run_full_sim() # third element in data is trajectory/LET info

    my_rng = ffrng.FastForwardRNG() # can also pass a seed number

    #output_array below is in electrons, can set apply_gain to True and
    # send a gain_txt file (32x32 supercells) in order to get the array in DN
    output_array = es.process_electrons_to_DN_by_blob2(rng_ff=my_rng,streaks=data[2],apply_gain=False)


GCRsim_v02i.py
==============

*Purpose*: Core simulation engine for generating GCR events and their interactions within the detector medium.
    
*Key Features*:
    
- Monte Carlo Particle Simulation: Realistic GCR particle generation using customizable input parameters (flux, energy spectrum, incident angle, etc.).
    
- Energy Deposition Modeling: Tracks energy loss and charge creation for each event using stochastic models.
    
- Delta Ray Production: Implements Poisson statistics for simulating secondary electron (“delta ray”) creation.
    
- Data Export: Outputs event data as CSV or HDF5 for further processing.
    
*Typical Usage*:
    
.. code-block:: python
  
    from GCRsim_v02i import CosmicRaySimulation
    
    # Set up a simulation instance and run
    sim = CosmicRaySimulation(config_file="config.yml")
    sim.run()
    sim.save("output_filename.h5")

*Inputs*:
    
- Detector/material properties (as config file or script arguments)
    
- Simulation settings (particle rate, simulation time, etc.)
    
*Outputs*:
    
- Tabular files (CSV/HDF5) with event-level energy deposition, position, and particle ID. This is run for a single species only, as specified by the species index passed in the config.yml file.
    
electron_spread2.py
===================

*Purpose*: Simulates charge diffusion and conversion of deposited energy into electron count and digital number (DN) maps.
    
*Key Features*:
    
- Charge Diffusion Modeling: Convolves initial energy depositions with spatially varying Gaussian kernels to mimic realistic electron/hole cloud spreading.
    
- Electron Conversion: Converts energy loss to charge using physical constants (Fano factor, ionization energy, etc.).
    
- Downsampling: Aggregates high-resolution simulation results into low-resolution DN maps matching detector readout.
    
- Batch Processing: Efficiently processes large CSV/HDF5 event datasets in chunks.
    
*Typical Usage*:
    
.. code-block:: python

    from electron_spread import process_electrons_to_DN
    
    process_electrons_to_DN(
        csvfile="gcr_events.csv",
        gain_txt="gain_table.txt",
        det_pixels_lo=4096,
        kernel_size_hi=50,
        sigma=0.314,
        output_DN_path="DN_map.npy"
    )

*Inputs*:
    
- Event list (CSV/HDF5) from GCRsim_v02f.py
    
- Detector gain/response table
    
*Outputs*:
    
- High-res and downsampled DN maps (NumPy arrays or image files)
    
GCR_GUI.py
==========

*Purpose*: Graphical user interface for interactive exploration and visualization of simulated GCR events and DN maps.
    
*Key Features*:
    
- Interactive Heatmap Viewer: Inspect downsampled and high-resolution DN maps with zoom, crosshair, and event selection.
    
- Overlay & Annotation: Visualize event positions, detector boundaries, and gridlines for spatial context.
    
- Event Inspection: Double-click to display detailed event info and high-res charge diffusion patterns.

- Export & Save Options: Save current visualizations or simulation state for further analysis.
    
*Typical Usage*:

.. code-block:: bash

    python GCR_GUI.py

or

.. code-block:: python
    
    import GCR_GUI
    GCR_GUI.run()

*Inputs*:
    
- Output files from GCRsim_v02f.py and electron_spread.py (event lists, DN maps, etc.)
    
*Outputs*:
    
- Interactive visualizations
    
- Exported plots or event data (optional)

Quickstart
Install dependencies:

.. code-block: bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt

Run a full simulation pipeline:

#. Simulate GCR events::

       python GCRsim_v02i.py --config config.yml --output gcr_events.h5

#. Process events to create DN maps::

       python electron_spread2.py --input gcr_events.h5 --output DN_map.npy

#. Visualize results with GUI::

python GCR_GUI.py

Note: The GUI requires tkinter. On some Linux systems you may need to run sudo apt-get install python3-tk.
