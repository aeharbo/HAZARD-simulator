    """
    Generate a single simulated cosmic-ray exposure and return a pixelated electron map.

    This function:
      1. Initializes a deterministic fast-forward RNG.
      2. Runs a full multi-species GCR simulation for a single exposure.
      3. Extracts the resulting particle trajectories (energy depositions).
      4. Passes the events to the charge-diffusion/pixelation pipeline.
      5. Returns the final detector image in electrons per pixel.

    Parameters
    ----------
    seed : int, default=1234
        Seed for the fast-forward random number generator used in charge diffusion.
        Controls deterministic reproducibility of stochastic sampling.
        Units: N/A.
    nat_pix : int, default=4088
        Detector size in pixels per side (assumes a square array).
        Units: pixels.
    date : float, default=2026.790
        Observation date expressed as a fractional year.
        Used by the GCR flux and solar-modulation model.
        Units: years (fractional year).
    dt : float, default=3.04
        Exposure time for the simulated frame.
        Units: seconds.
    apply_padding : bool, default=False
        If True, applies edge padding during the simulation to mitigate boundary effects.
    settings_dict : dict or None, optional
        Placeholder for additional simulation configuration parameters.
        (Currently unused.)

    Returns
    -------
    out_array : numpy.ndarray
        2D array of simulated detector response in electrons per pixel.
        Shape: ``(nat_pix, nat_pix)``.
        Units: electrons.

    Notes
    -----
    - Gain is not applied in this wrapper (``apply_gain=False`` is passed to the
      charge-diffusion routine), so the output is in electrons rather than DN.
    - The returned frame represents a single simulated exposure suitable for
      downstream analysis or visualization.

    Run a single-frame GCR simulation from the command line and save the result.

    This function:
      1. Records and prints the simulation start time.
      2. Calls ``generate_singleframe_cr`` to produce one simulated detector frame.
      3. Reports the array shape and total runtime.
      4. Saves the output array to disk as a NumPy ``.npy`` file with a timestamped name.

    Returns
    -------
    None

    Side Effects
    ------------
    - Writes a ``.npy`` file containing the simulated frame to the current directory.
    - Prints timing and status information to standard output.

    Notes
    -----
    - Intended as a simple executable entry point for testing and benchmarking the
      GCR simulation + charge-diffusion pipeline.
    - The output file is saved in electrons per pixel (no gain applied).
